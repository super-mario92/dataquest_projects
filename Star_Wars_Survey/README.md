# Star_Wars_Survey
Cleaning and exploring of a dataset based on Star Wars questions from fivethirtyeight (https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/star-wars-survey).

While waiting for Star Wars: The Force Awakens to come out, the team at FiveThirtyEight became interested in answering some questions about Star Wars fans. In particular, they wondered: does the rest of America realize that “The Empire Strikes Back” is clearly the best of the bunch?
In this Project I clean and explore the dataset.

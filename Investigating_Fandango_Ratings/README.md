# Investigating_Fandango_Ratings
In October 2015, a data journalist named Walt Hickey analyzed movie ratings data and found strong evidence to suggest that Fandango's rating system was biased and dishonest (Fandango is an online movie ratings aggregator).

Fandango claimed it was a bug that should have been removed by now. The goal of the project is to figure out whether there has been any change in Fandango's rating system after Hickey's analysis.
